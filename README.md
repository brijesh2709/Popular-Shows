This code is the made using contructivist style code crated by Dr. Crista Lopez. According to the description, every single function checks the sanity of its arguments returns something sensible or assigns them reasonable values. All code blocks check for possible errors and escape the block when things go wrong. Error handling is taken into detailed consideration. In my code I had followed the same structure as Lopez's style. I had also handled errors in the desired way. Every function in my code serves its ows purpose and returns something sensible and passes on the traits to each function.
